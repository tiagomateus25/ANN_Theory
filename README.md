# ANN_Theory
This repository was created so I could learn the very basics of building artificial neural networks in raw python and understand the mathematics behind them. No AI frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow are used. 

For this purpose I used a book called "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python" by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukie≈Ça. The book can be bought at: https://nnfs.io/
