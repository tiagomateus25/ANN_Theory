# ANN_Theory
This repository was created so i could learn the very basics of building artificial neural networks in raw python and understand the mathematics behind them. No AI frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow are used. Only NumPy  library is used.

The "course" I took for this can be found on a YouTube channel called sentdex. It is compiled in a playlist called Neural Networks from Scratch in Python by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukieta.

Here's the link for that playlist:
